AIPI 590 - XAI | Assignment: Interpretable ML
Understand the factors that contribute to customer churn (customers leaving the Telecom company for a competitor) and develop interpretable models to predict which customers are at risk of churning.

This file begins with EDA to identify key drivers like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. Next, it checks model assumptions for linear, logistic, and GAM approaches. Then, it fits and compares the three models on churn prediction. Finally, it provides a recommendation based on the performance and interpretability of the different models.
